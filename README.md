# Breakdown of Assets

### Big Tech

40% of the portfolio is allocated to investments in Blockchain, Web3, and Information Systems technologies. With the increasing demand for computational power driven by advancements in AI, both software and hardware markets are projected to experience significant growth in 2025. This allocation strategically positions the portfolio to capitalize on this anticipated expansion.

### ETFs

A larger portion of the portfolio (10%) has been allocated to the FTSE 100, reflecting an expectation of the Dollar strengthening against the Pound in the coming year, potentially spurred by market shifts following geopolitical changes, such as Trump's inauguration. This represents an arbitrage opportunity for US-based investors.

Additionally, 5% of the portfolio is allocated to the NASDAQ as a supplementary investment in technology-focused securities, providing added resilience within the tech sector. A further 15% is allocated to the S&P 500, aiming to enhance the overall portfolio's stability and performance through exposure to a broad and diversified range of US equities.

### Individual Stocks

The portfolio's stock allocation employs a balanced approach to risk and market trends. Approximately 15% of the selected stocks align with general market trends, offering stable and predictable growth potential. Conversely, the remaining 15% comprises contrarian picks, chosen for their potential to outperform the market by leveraging opportunities overlooked by broader market participants.

These contrarian stocks have been meticulously selected using advanced analysis on the Bloomberg Terminal, supported by insights from recent news, expert recommendations, and market signals sourced through various specialized functions.
